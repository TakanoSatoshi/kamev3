    - Add xSensors (eXternal Sensors) feature: 
      - xTouch (24 multi-touch on screen keyboard),

      - Motors: speed, rotate, tacho "sensor", forward, backward


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features to add (no specific order):
 - Add import/export feature (save all the data on the ev3 in one operation) - Will be done while JRE 1.8 is the default leJOS JRE.
 - Add real time sensor probes
 - Add port checking (auto detection for EV3 devices)
 - Add API for other LEGO EV3 sensors (Gyro sensor) - Will be done while I buy these two sensors :-)
 - Add new xSensors (eg. xAudio) and other modes to existing xSensors (eg. video object detection for balls/round items, etc.)
 - Add support for leJOS 0.9.1-beta (currently 0.9.0-beta)
