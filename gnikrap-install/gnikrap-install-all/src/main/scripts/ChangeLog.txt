Version history:
 0.4.0 (28APR2015 - leJOS Firmware/Menu integration)
    - Easy use (no more need telnet/ssh/scp) / leJOS integration:
      - Automated GUI installation on Windows.
      - Shell script (for the EV3) for others platforms.
      - Gnikrap is installed as a leJOS 'Program', it can be launched directly from the leJOS menu
      - Shutdown EV3 brick / Stop Gnikrap (<=> return to leJOS menu) from the Gnikrap user interface
    - xGeo (GPS) xSensor added
    - Update versions of some library used (especially: leJOS updated to 0.9.0-beta)
    - Documentation updated

    - Fix: 
      - API for the EV3 brick screen is now operational (include import of images for displaying on the EV3 screen)


 0.3.0 (30JAN2015 - xSensors):
    - Add xSensors (eXternal Sensors) feature: 
      - xTouch (24 multi-touch on screen keyboard), 
      - xVideo (video object tracking), 
      - xGyro (gyroscope)
    - Rework and improve the GUI (now works fine on Android)
    - Improve the script API
    - Documentation updated, new samples added
    - Add automatic EV3 brick reconnection (in case of connection lost)


 0.2.0 (30NOV2014 - First public release):
    - Load/Delete/Save script added
    - About box added
    - GUI Internationalization (English and French are available)
    - Jackson JSON parser replaced by 'minimal-json' which is faster on the EV3 hardware
    - Documentation added
    - Improve the script API to manipulate the EV3 brick


 0.1.0 (private release):
    - Proof of concept: Ensure that the performance reached are acceptable
    - Simple API to manipulate the EV3 brick:
      - Battery
      - Sound: play tone, play note
      - Keyboard: leds and buttons
      - Screen (very limited support): only clear :-(
      - Touch sensor
      - Color Sensor: reflected, ambiant, color
      - IR Sensor: distance, seek beacon, remote command
      - Motors: speed, rotate, tacho "sensor", forward, backward


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features to add (no specific order):
 - Add import/export feature (save all the data on the ev3 in one operation) - Will be done while JRE 1.8 is the default leJOS JRE.
 - Add real time sensor probes
 - Add port checking (auto detection for EV3 devices)
 - Add a visual (or mix) code editing (better usability on tablets) (eg: GRAFSET - http://www.gojs.net/beta/samples/grafcet.html, Blocky: https://developers.google.com/blockly/)
 - Add API for other LEGO EV3 sensors (Gyro sensor, Ultrasonic sensor) - Will be done while I buy these two sensors :-)
 - Add new xSensors (eg. xAudio) and other modes to existing xSensors (eg. video object detection for balls/round items, etc.)
