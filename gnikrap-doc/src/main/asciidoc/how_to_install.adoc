== How to install

Here are the steps needed in order to have Gnikrap working on your EV3:


. Download and install http://www.lejos.org/[leJOS] as described on the page: http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Installing%20leJOS/[Installing leJOS

. Configure a network link between your computer and the EV3:
** Either with Wifi, see http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Configuring%20Wifi/[Configuring Wifi]
** Either with bluetooth PAN, see http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Configuring%20Bluetooth%20PAN/[Pairing (from the PC)]

. Download the Gnikrap distribution https://github.com/jbenech/gnikrap/releases/download/Gnikrap-0.2.0/gnikrap-core-0.2.0.zip[here]

. Donwload WinSCP http://winscp.net/eng/download.php[here] (the Portable distribution does it)

. Connect by using the following settings (Host name can depend of your network settings. 
  10.0.1.1 is the IP address to use while connected with bluetooth):

_Note:_ The network speed with the EV3 is quite slow.

. Download Putty http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.zip[here]

. Connect to the EV3 brick with Putty

Login with "root" as user and no password: image:install/0110_Putty_Login.png[]

.Unzip the Gnikrap software:
** Create a folder for Gnikrap with the command `mkdir gnikrap-0.2.0`
+
_Note: "gnikrap-0.2.0" has to be replaced by the folder name of your choice.
** Unzip the files with the command `unzip gnikrap-core-0.2.0.zip -d gnikrap-0.2.0
+
_Note:_ "gnikrap-core-0.2.0.zip" has to be replaced by the right zip filename. "gnikrap-0.2.0" has to be replaced by the folder name of your choice.

. Optionally, kill the current running lejos:
** Found, the process with the command: `ps | grep ejre`.
** Kill the process with the command: `kill 1527` where "1527" is the process Id found with the ps command

. Launch Gnikrap:
** Go to the bin folder: `cd gnikrap-0.2.0/bin`
** Start Gnikrap: `./start.sh`

. Finally open a browser on your computer and connect to Gnikrap with the following URL: `http://10.0.1.1`
  You should have (it will take several seconds to download) the Gnikrap main screen:

+
_Note:_ The first time you launch a script it will take several seconds (more than 10s), because there some initialization to be done. 
        Latter script execution are instantaneous.

. In order to shutdown the EV3 brick you should stop the Gnikrap application kbd:[Ctrl + C]. 
  Then you should use the command: `shutdown -h now`

        
            
Note: I plan to provide an image pre-packaged (See Release note and future plan for more details)
