== How to install

=== Prerequesite: Install leJOS

[WARNING]
====
Version 0.5.0 of Gnikrap work with LeJOS 0.9.0-beta
====

Before installing Gnikrap, you need to have a working leJOS firmware. Moreover, a network (either Wifi or bluetooth should have been configured.

Lejos installation::
. Download and install http://www.lejos.org/[leJOS] as described on the page: http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Installing%20leJOS/[Installing leJOS]
. Configure a network link between your computer and the EV3:
** Either with Wifi, see http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Configuring%20Wifi/[Configuring Wifi]
** Either with bluetooth PAN, see http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Configuring%20Bluetooth%20PAN/[Pairing (from the PC)]

While leJOS is correctly setup and configured, you should have a screen like the following one:

You can notice the IP adress which is in this snapshot: 10.0.1.1


=== Install for Windows users

You're lucky, you benefit of a full automated install.

** Download the Gnikrap distribution for Windows https://github.com/jbenech/gnikrap/releases[here] (file gnikrap-install-windows-<Version>.zip)
** Unzip the distribution and launch the program `insall_on_ev3.exe`. This program will ask you the IP address of the EV3 and will install
leJOS on the EV3. +
_Note:_ The IP address is displayed on the screen while leJOS is installed and running.

That's all ! You can now run Gnikrap, see <<Launch Gnikrap>>


=== Install for non Windows users

** Download the Gnikrap distribution for all operating systems (install-all) https://github.com/jbenech/gnikrap/releases[here] (file gnikrap-install-all-<Version>.tar.gz)
** Upload the tar.gz file on the brick. You can upload on the brick by using the a software that implement the SCP protocol (eg on Windows: http://winscp.net/eng/download.php[WinSCP])
** Once uploaded, you need to connect (either with telnet or ssh) to the EV3. (eg on Windows, http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.zip[Putty]) +
   _Note:_ The login to use is "root" and there is no password.
** Once connected, decompress the tar.gz file with a command like: `tar -xzf gnikrap-install-all-<Version>.tar.gz` (Replace <Version> with the right version according to the file you have)
** Go to the folder just created with a command like: `cd gnikrap-install-all-<Version>` (Here again, <Version> has to be replaced with the right version)
** Last but not least, launch the Gnikrap install with the command: `./install.sh` +
   Note: If Gnikrap has already been installed, the program can prompt you to confirm the uninstallation/update of the previously installed version.


=== Launch Gnikrap   

** With the leJOS menu go to 'Programs' menu click on the middle button.
** On the 'Files' list, select Gnikrap and click again on the middle button.
** Select 'Execute program' (this is the default) and click again on the middle button.
** The following screen is displayed:

Just wait about 20 seconds. Then an empty screen will be displayed for a few seconds. Again just wait.

** Once Gnikrap was launched, you can connect with a browser (Note: Once the Gnikrap welcome screen was displayed, you have to wait a few seconds +
   before being able to connect with a browser).
