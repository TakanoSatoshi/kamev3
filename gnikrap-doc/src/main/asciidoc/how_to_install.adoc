== How to install

The installation consist of several steps:

** Install leJOS
** Download Gnikrap and tools needed for installation
** Install Gnikrap
** Launch Gnikrap (only this step has to be performed once installed)


Here are the steps needed in order to have Gnikrap working on your EV3:

Lejos installation::
. Download and install http://www.lejos.org/[leJOS] as described on the page: http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Installing%20leJOS/[Installing leJOS
. Configure a network link between your computer and the EV3:
** Either with Wifi, see http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Configuring%20Wifi/[Configuring Wifi]
** Either with bluetooth PAN, see http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Configuring%20Bluetooth%20PAN/[Pairing (from the PC)]

Download gnikrap and other tools needed for the installation::
. Download the Gnikrap distribution https://github.com/jbenech/gnikrap/releases/download/Gnikrap-0.2.0/gnikrap-core-0.2.0.zip[here]
. Donwload WinSCP http://winscp.net/eng/download.php[here] (the Portable distribution does it)
. Download Putty http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.zip[here]

Copy and install Gnikrap::
. Connect by using the following settings (Host name can depend of your network settings. 
  10.0.1.1 is the IP address to use while connected with bluetooth):

_Note:_ The network speed with the EV3 is quite slow.

. Connect to the EV3 brick with Putty

Login with "root" as user and no password: image:install/0110_Putty_Login.png[]

. Uncompress the Gnikrap software:
** Uncompress the files with the command `tar -xz -f gnikrap-core-0.3.0.tar.gz`

Launch Gnikrap::
. If needed, connect to the EV3 brick with a telnet client (see putty section above)

. Launch Gnikrap:
** Go to the bin folder: `cd gnikrap-core-0.3.0/bin`
** Start Gnikrap: `./start.sh`

. Finally open a browser on your computer and connect to Gnikrap with the following URL: `http://<IP of the EV3>`
  You should have the Gnikrap main screen - See <<Quick overview>> for the screenshot - (it can take a few seconds to load).
+
_Note:_ The first time you launch a script it will take several seconds (more than 10s), because there some initialization to be done. 
        Latter script execution are instantaneous.

. While shutdown of the EV3 brick is needed, you can use the leJOS menu.


[NOTE]
====
In some cases, there is not enough memory on the EV3 brick to have 2 java process running at the same time. 
The solution is to kill the leJOS process (the menu). In order to do that you have to:

- Stop the Gnikrap application kbd:[Ctrl + C]. 
- Found, the process with the command: `ps | grep ejre`.
- Kill the process with the command: `kill 1527` where "1527" is the process Id found with the ps command
- Relaunch the Gnikrap application (see below).

While the menu has been killed, you have to stop the brick manually:

- Stop the Gnikrap application kbd:[Ctrl + C]. 
- Shutdown the EV3 brick by using the command: `shutdown -h now`

Note: There is a plan in order to provide a packaging more simple to use (See <<Changelog>> for more details)
