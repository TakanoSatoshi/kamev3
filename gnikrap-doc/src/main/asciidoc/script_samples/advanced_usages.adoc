=== Advanced usage

* Defining/Using script library file of utility/standard functions. It is possible to do it, 
  however the syntax can change in future version of Gnikrap (the Javascript engine currently enbedded in Java7 
  is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino[Rhino],
  while the Javascript engine embedded in Java8 is http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html[Nashorm]). +
  Knowing that point, if you still want to import script, the current syntax (for Java7) is TODO (TODO-LINK).

* Using Java library. Another question could be how to use Java library (eg. Lejos) directly for the script engine. 
  Here again, it is possible, but part of the syntax can change in future versions.
